      <h2>East Toronto Chinese Baptist Church</h2>
      <h2 class="mobile">ETCBC</h2>
      <p>In the late 1990's the church leadership was greatly influenced by the Purpose Driven Church by Rick Warren and have as such sought to guide our ministries and leadership structure around it. In fact, this philosophy also then drove the writing of our present mission statement, which is as follows:
      <span class="quote">To bring our friends to Jesus Christ through evangelism, incorporate them into His fellowship, discipling them into Christ-like maturity equipping them for their ministry, in order to be a people who worship and glorify God's name.</span>
As members of the Canadian Baptists of Ontario and Quebec, we strive and hold to the convention core values and distinctive.</p>

         <div class="program-content">
             <p><img src="images/InnerCourt.png" />We believe music is a beautiful medium that can reach wide groups of people, allowing them to enter God’s presence and approach Him no matter what their circumstances. Since we believe God ultimately seeks people (John 4:23), music that is appropriate to our congregation is used regularly to allow worship in spirit and truth (John 4:24) towards our audience of One. Our rotational worship teams consists of the following foundations: Fellowship, Growth, Reverence, Corporate Worship, Integration</p>
             <p>
             Let His glory be disseminated to all ends of the earth with our voices! If you have gifts in music and would like to help in this area of ministry, please contact our worship ministry coordinator, <a href="mailto:bryan.fung@etcbc.org">Bryan Fung</a> for more details.</p>

             <p>Developing intellectually in faith has always been an important and integral part of growth for ETCBC. Beyond simply loving God with all our mind, understanding the faith deeper will transform every area of life from spiritual disciplines to daily living choices. Though teaching comes in many different forms and settings, the primary method currently is through Sunday School ministry.</p>
             <p>Classes run on Sundays from 11:40am to 1pm, in the East Basement classroom at the bottom of the stairs from the Fellowship Hall.  We follow the school term and, as such, classes are scheduled from September to April. </p>

            Adult Small Groups is an integral part of ETCBC. When asking our very own Sam Mo about small group, he had this to say (he took more time to reply):
 
            <span class="quote"><p>In small group, we do life together.  We share our joys, fears and disappointments with each other.  It is a place where we can be vulnerable, open and accepted exactly as we are.  A place where we can experience God’s love through each other and also challenge each other.  When we live in community, we go through all the ups and downs of life together and are able to see each other for who we truly are.</p>
                <p>                Small group is also a place where we learn and grow.  It is where we can take what was preached and taught on Sunday, and dig deeper.  It is where we can learn in a smaller, more intimate environment about touchy subjects such as personal struggles, tithing and emotional health.  It is where we learn about God’s character and actions through the various programs we engage in.</p></span>
            <p>When asking our very own Albert Kong about small groups (that’s him in the purple shirt below!), he had this to say:</p>
            <span class="quote">I believe that Small groups is an important way of how our community can organize the embodiment and practice of the love of Christ it roots itself in. It’s a focused place where faith and lives can be discovered and shared in deeper wards, and where relationships can grow and extend outwards.</span>
            <p> We currently support over 10 small groups, and it’s constantly growing!</p>
            <p>If you would like to commit and join one of our several ETCBC Small Groups, please contact our EMC or EMC Fellowship Head.</p>

      <img src="images/nehemiah.jpg" />
      <p>You've heard about it. You've seen a glimmer of its potential impact through the light basement renovations. Now hear, understand, and pray for the next major ETCBC project since the formation of the Inner Court several years ago!</p>
      <p>Nehemiah is the name of our upcoming major renovation project, aimed at providing a safer and more engaging environment for our children, ministries, and congregants; opening up opportunities and revigoring existing ones.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned on this page for newsletters and other information... it may very well get so big that it'll be branched off on its own!</p>
